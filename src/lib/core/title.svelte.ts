 * The page title shown in the browser tab. The root layout renders

 * `$effect` when it depends on loaded data, or once at script top when static).
 * `beforeNavigate` in the root layout clears it so a page that sets nothing
 * falls back to plain "Nuvio".
 *
 * Client-only on purpose: it's a module singleton, so writing to it during SSR
 * would leak one request's title into another. The server always renders
 * "Nuvio" and the client fills in the real title on mount.
